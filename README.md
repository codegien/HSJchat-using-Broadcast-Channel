# HSJchat-using-Broadcast-Channel

A simple, front-end-only real-time chat application that allows users to communicate across multiple tabs within the same browser. This project uses the **BroadcastChannel API** to simulate real-time messaging without needing a backend. Users can open multiple tabs, enter their name, and send messages that are instantly shared and displayed across all open tabs.

## Project Structure

```plaintext
üìÅ HSJchat-realtime-chat
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ index.html      # Main HTML file for the chat UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ styles.css      # Basic styling for the chat UI
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ script.js       # JavaScript logic to handle the chat functionality
```

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Messages are instantly displayed across all open tabs within the same browser.
- **User Identification**: Users can add their name to each message to distinguish themselves in the chat.
- **Automatic Scrolling**: The chat window automatically scrolls to display the latest message.
- **Simple UI**: Clean and responsive design using HTML and CSS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

All you need is a modern web browser that supports the **BroadcastChannel API** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codegien/HSJchat-using-Broadcast-Channel.git
   cd HSJchat-using-Broadcast-Channel
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   Open `index.html` in your browser by double-clicking it, or you can use a command to open it in your default browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

3. **Start Chatting**:
   Open multiple tabs with `index.html` in the same browser and begin typing your username and messages to chat in real time.

## Usage

1. **Enter Your Name**: Type your name in the username field (e.g., "Alice").
2. **Send Messages**: Type your message in the message field and click "Send" or press `Enter`.
3. **View Across Tabs**: Open more tabs with `index.html` in the same browser and see messages appear in real-time across all tabs.

## How It Works

The **BroadcastChannel API** allows communication between scripts in multiple contexts (tabs, windows, or iframes) within the same browser. Here‚Äôs how the chat app operates:

1. **Creating a Channel**: Each tab creates a `BroadcastChannel` instance named `chatChannel`.
2. **Broadcasting Messages**: When a message is sent, it's posted to `chatChannel`, which is received by listeners in all tabs.
3. **Displaying Messages**: Each tab displays received messages in the chat window in real time.

---

## Code Explanation

- **HTML (`index.html`)**: Defines the chat interface structure with fields for username and message input, a send button, and a chat display area.
- **CSS (`styles.css`)**: Styles the chat interface, including input fields, buttons, and the chat display area.
- **JavaScript (`script.js`)**: Contains the logic for message broadcasting, receiving, and displaying messages across tabs.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Same-Browser Restriction**: Works only across tabs in the same browser and device. Cross-browser communication isn‚Äôt possible with BroadcastChannel alone.
- **Non-Persistent Messages**: Messages are cleared when the browser is closed, as there‚Äôs no backend to store them.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Add WebSocket or Firebase support for real-time communication across different devices and browsers.
- **Persistent Storage**: Integrate with a backend database (e.g., Firebase) to store messages persistently.
